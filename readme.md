## start 
```
    docker run -it --privileged cc861010/head
```
* first to install a [server ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD) with docker server，other linux ,like coreos,is ok but it's not test

## what 
* run a i3wm desktop envicerment in a host which has display and input devices 
* the host is a command line linux which can only has a docker service
## why
1. run different system envicerment at the same time on one machine eg,game,development,and so on
2. to isolate different environments
3. install a system with desktop quickly,just one command
